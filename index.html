  <h1>GachaMations</h1>
  <p>This is a pretty basic website for information about my accounts, along with my current projects tied to it.<br>This account doesn't get much usage, as this is an old Gacha account, that isn't very good, and has... pretty cringy details (I need a new username and pfp) but I do login every so often on YouTube. Though, this is not my main account, just another account I have for Gacha content, as a lot of people have a bad look on the community, so I will not give the link to my main channel, nor will I post anything to do with this channel on my main.<br><br></p>
  <p>I currently have 1 project going, and that is the Gacha Unity projects. Information about these are available below, but currently only the Gacha Life Unity project is public.<br><br></p>
  <p>This site obviously isn't very complete, and I'll improve upon the site the longer it stays up. Currently there is just some basic HTML, CSS and JS, but they will be improved eventually. It's just a matter of time.</p>
